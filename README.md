# Rock Paper Scissors 

This is a program that detects what hand motion a player is holding up then returns the hand motion that will beat it. 

The code is almost all from [this video by cvzone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2EahPgl0ho).
I just added the capability where it beats the player. I also highly increased the accuracy of the hand signal detection. 

## How to Use
`pip install -r requirments.txt `

`python3 main.py`
- Press "s" to start a round
- Press "q" to quit
